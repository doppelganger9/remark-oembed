# remark-oembed

[![Downloads][downloads-badge]][downloads] [![Chat][chat-badge]][chat]

Converts URLs surrounded by newlines into embeds.

The important part of this code is taken directly from
[Benedicte Raae](https://www.raae.codes/)'s excellent
[gatsby-remark-oembed](https://github.com/raae/gatsby-remark-oembed) plugin, so
thank you very much [@raae](https://github.com/raae) üôè

## Installation

[yarn][]:

```bash
yarn add @agentofuser/remark-oembed
```

## Usage

Say we have the following file, `demo.md`:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```markdown
Hey this is a nice youtube video about making modern react apps with gatsby:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN0xHSk2P8Q

Check it out üëÜ
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```javascript
var fs = require('fs')
var remark = require('remark')
var oembed = require('@agentofuser/remark-oembed')

remark()
  .use(oembed)
  .process(fs.readFileSync('demo.md'), function(err, file) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```markdown
Hey this is a nice youtube video about making modern react apps with gatsby:

<iframe 
  width="480" 
  height="270" 
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GN0xHSk2P8Q?feature=oembed" 
  frameborder="0" 
  allow="accelerometer; 
    autoplay; 
    encrypted-media; 
    gyroscope; 
    picture-in-picture" 
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

## API

### `remark().use(oembed)`

Converts URLs surrounded by newlines into embeds.

#### usePrefix

`remark().use(oembed)` is the same as `remark().use(oembed({usePrefix: false, replaceParent: false}))`.

If you `usePrefix: true`, you must use a code block with `oembed:` as prefix:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```markdown
Hey this is a nice youtube video about making modern react apps with gatsby:

`oembed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN0xHSk2P8Q`

Check it out üëÜ
```

#### replaceParent

Sometimes, like with Twitter, the OEmbed HTML contains block HTML elements, which should make the paragraph end. So there may be a trailing `</p>` after stringifying it.

If that's the case, you can replace the parent paragraph node with the child link or inline code node using `replaceParent: true`.

`remark().use(oembed({replaceParent: true}))`

See `test/test.js` for examples.

### OEmbed API additional params

For example, [Twitter OEmbed API documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/moments/guides/oembed-api) say it is possible to add parameters in addition to url.

You might want to avoid loading the script and maybe change the language.

In the plugin options, pass the provider name and the additional parameters to pass to the oembed provider call:

`remark().use(oembed({Twitter: {lang: 'fr-FR', omit_script: 1}))`

(For this specific example, you'll need to add `<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>` in your markdown, as the plugin will ask the OEmbed Twitter API to omit them.)
